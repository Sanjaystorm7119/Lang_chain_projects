An essay is a focused piece of writing that develops an idea or argument using evidence, analysis, and interpretation.  It is commonly used in academic settings to assess a student's understanding of a topic, with university-level essays typically being argumentative—aiming to persuade the reader of a specific position. 

Key Features of an Essay
Purpose: To present a clear argument or analysis, often in response to a specific question. 
Structure: Most essays follow a three-part structure:
Introduction: Includes a hook, background information, and a thesis statement that outlines the main argument.
Body: Consists of multiple paragraphs, each with a topic sentence, supporting evidence, and analysis.  Common structures include point-evidence-analysis (PEA) or logical ordering (chronological, spatial, or emphatic).
Conclusion: Summarizes key points, restates the thesis in new words, and leaves the reader with a final thought or implication. 
Types of Essays
Common types include:

Argumentative: Persuades the reader of a particular viewpoint using evidence. 
Analytical/Critical: Examines a text, idea, or work in depth. 
Descriptive: Uses sensory details to vividly describe a person, place, or event. 
Narrative: Tells a story, often from a personal perspective. 
Compare/Contrast: Highlights similarities and differences between two subjects. 
Informative: Educates the reader about a topic without taking a stance. 
Writing Process
Preparation: Define the topic, research sources, create a thesis, and outline the essay.

Revision: Evaluate organization, revise content, proofread for grammar/spelling, and use a plagiarism checker.
